      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="Habout">
        One of the challenges I face in creating a website using HTML is
        ensuring that the code is well-structured and semantically correct,
        which I am still trying to do. I am trying to achieve this by using
        appropriate HTML tags to create a logical hierarchy of content and
        avoiding the misuse of tags or attributes. Another aspect which takes
        time is testing and debugging my website as this is crucial to ensure
        that it is functioning correctly across different devices and web
        browsers, but it is essential to deliver a user-friendly experience.
        Overall, creating a website using HTML requires a combination of
        technical skills, creativity, and attention to detail. More important is
        practice and perseverance, as it takes time to get control over using
        HTML.
      </p>
      <p class="Habout">
        Alongside, HTML is CSS. This is a critical component in the web
        development of my website, as CSS allows me to style and format the
        content of the website. With CSS, I control the layout, colours, and
        visual effects of your website, making it more visually appealing and
        user-friendly. One of the most significant benefits I have found while
        using CSS is that it allows you to separate the presentation layer of
        your website from the content layer. This means I could define the
        visual style of your website in one place, making it easier to maintain
        and update my site's design. Overall, I want to show how I have taken my
        knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to create an impactful website
        that will allow me to further my understanding and knowledge to help
        others.

      <h1>What i want to achieve</h1>
      <p class="Habout">
        I want to achieve an effective and communicative User Experience. The
        user experience is how a user interacts with the website. I would like
        to make my website easy for users to find what they're looking for and
        to navigate through my website seamlessly. I will achieve this by having
        a clear and organized layout, fast loading times, and mobile
        optimization, so it will be useable on different types of platforms.
      </p>
      <p class="Habout">
        Another aspect I will achieve in a great website is my content. My
        websiteâ€™s content will be relevant, and engaging content that provides
        value to the user.
      </p>
      <p class="Habout">
        I like also to focus on the design. The design of my website will be
        visually appealing and consistent with my brand. This will be done
        through my colour scheme of colour which I like and which I feel
        represent me, and imagery that reflects on me while still appealing to
        your user
